        <h1 id="Delaware-State-Lottery-Nets-Huge-Gambling-Profits"><a href="#Delaware-State-Lottery-Nets-Huge-Gambling-Profits" class="headerlink" title="Delaware State Lottery Nets Huge Gambling Profits"></a>Delaware State Lottery Nets Huge Gambling Profits</h1><p>For the past few years, Delaware state officials have been cashing in on legalized gambling, thanks to the state lottery. In 2015, the lottery netted over $200 million in profits, a significant increase from the year before. Much of this increase is due to new games that have been introduced in recent years, such as instant tickets and Powerball.</p>
<p>In addition to the lottery, Delaware also offers casino gambling at three racetracks. These casinos have been especially successful, with revenue from slots and table games totaling over $500 million in 2015. This money goes towards supporting important state programs such as education and healthcare.</p>
<p>Critics of gambling argue that it is a regressive tax that disproportionately impacts the poor. However, supporters argue that it is a voluntary tax that allows people to spend their money on recreation instead of necessities. And while there is no doubt that gambling can be addictive and destructive, proponents argue that it can also be a harmless form of entertainment for responsible adults.</p>
<p>Whatever your opinion on gambling may be, there’s no doubt that it is a big business in Delaware. With millions of dollars being generated each year, it is clear that the state lottery and casino industry are here to stay.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Casinos-Bring-in-Over-1B-in-Revenue"><a href="#Delaware-Casinos-Bring-in-Over-1B-in-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Casinos Bring in Over $1B in Revenue"></a>Delaware Casinos Bring in Over $1B in Revenue</h1><p>Delaware’s casinos generated over $1B in revenue in 2017, making it one of the most popular casino destinations in the United States. The three casinos in Delaware – Harrington Raceway and Casino, Dover Downs Hotel and Casino, and Delaware Park Racetrack and Casino – brought in a combined $1.02B in revenue last year, up from $956M in 2016.</p>
<p>The casinos are a major source of revenue for the state, accounting for over 16% of Delaware’s total tax revenue in 2017. The increase in revenue is due to both an increase in the number of visitors to the casinos and an increase in the amount they are spending on games.</p>
<p>Delaware is one of only five states where casino gambling is legal, and it has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. The state has worked hard to make its casinos appealing to visitors, with features like luxury hotels, fine dining, and world-class entertainment.</p>
<p>The success of Delaware’s casinos is good news for the state economy. They provide jobs for thousands of people, generate tax revenue that helps fund important government programs, and contribute millions of dollars to local businesses. If you’re looking for a fun weekend getaway or some exciting casino action, you should definitely check out Delaware’s casinos!</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Rakes-in-More-Than-500M-from-Gambling"><a href="#Delaware-Rakes-in-More-Than-500M-from-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Rakes in More Than $500M from Gambling"></a>Delaware Rakes in More Than $500M from Gambling</h1><p>Casinos, racetracks and online gambling sites in Delaware brought in more than $500 million in revenue during the 2017 fiscal year, according to figures released by the Delaware Lottery.</p>
<p>The state’s casinos generated the most revenue of any type of gambling establishment, raking in more than $265 million. That was followed by the state’s three racetracks, which took in nearly $115 million. The state’s six online gambling sites brought in nearly $120 million.</p>
<p>Revenue from all forms of gambling has increased steadily in Delaware in recent years. The state took in just over $425 million from gambling during the 2016 fiscal year, and just over $390 million during the 2015 fiscal year.</p>
<p>Delaware Governor John Carney praised the state’s gambling industry for its contributions to the economy.</p>
<p>“Gambling is an important part of our tourism industry and helps support good-paying jobs throughout our state,” Carney said in a statement. “I want to thank our casino operators and employees for their commitment to delivering a great experience for visitors, and I congratulate them on another successful year.”</p>
<p>Gambling advocates say that revenue from casinos and other forms of legalized gambling can be used to support important social programs. opponents argue that casinos can have negative consequences for local communities.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Tops-Other-States-in-Gambling-Revenues"><a href="#Delaware-Tops-Other-States-in-Gambling-Revenues" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Tops Other States in Gambling Revenues"></a>Delaware Tops Other States in Gambling Revenues</h1><p>In 2017, Delaware gambling revenues amounted to $577 million, more than any other state in the country. The vast majority of this revenue came from casino gambling; slot machines accounted for over two-thirds of Delaware’s gaming revenue.</p>
<p>Delaware’s gambling industry is supported by three casinos: Dover Downs Hotel &amp; Casino, Harrington Raceway &amp; Casino, and the new Live! Casino near Wilmington. Dover Downs is the largest casino in the state, generating over half of Delaware’s total gambling revenue.</p>
<p>Delaware became the first state to legalize casino gambling in 1976. The state has since made several amendments to its gambling laws, most notably in 1999 when it allowed slot machines at racetracks. In recent years, Delaware has seen a decline in its traditional manufacturing sector and has looked to gambling as a way to boost its economy.</p>
<p>While Delaware leads the nation in gambling revenue, it is not alone in seeking to exploit this source of income. A number of other states have also legalized casino gambling in recent years, including Pennsylvania, New York, and Michigan. These states are all seeking to capture a piece of the casino gaming market, which is growing rapidly nationwide.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Netting-Millions-from-Gambling"><a href="#Delaware-Netting-Millions-from-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Netting Millions from Gambling"></a>Delaware Netting Millions from Gambling</h1><p>The tiny state of Delaware is raking in millions from gambling, thanks to its lack of restrictions on what kinds of games can be offered.</p>
<p>Gambling services are big business in Delaware, and the industry is only growing. In fact, the gambling industry contributed $8 million to the state’s coffers in taxes in 2017 alone. That number is expected to grow in 2018 as more casinos come online.</p>
<p>What makes Delaware so attractive to gambling operators? The state has few restrictions on what types of casino games can be offered. That means online casinos can offer a wide variety of games, including slots, blackjack, and roulette. And because there is no residency requirement, anyone from anywhere can gamble online in Delaware.</p>
<p>The growth of the gambling industry in Delaware has been a boon to the state’s economy. In addition to generating tax revenue, the industry has also created jobs. In 2017, the gambling industry employed 1,500 people in Delaware. That number is expected to grow as more casinos come online.</p>
<p>The success of Delaware’s gambling industry shows that there is demand for these types of services. Other states should take note and consider relaxing their own restrictions on gambling. This would allow operators to offer a wider variety of games and generate much-needed tax revenue for these states</p>
