Walking Dead Island is no exception. To create a successful game, in addition to programming, you need to have the following skillsets:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Artist: No matter how well written your code is, it won’t look or feel good without good art. Artists make the world look beautiful (or gruesome, depending on the game), animate characters, and create textures and props.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sound Designer: In many cases, audio can be more important than graphics in creating an immersive experience. Sound designers create sounds for everything from footsteps to weapon clashes to voice acting.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Game Designer: A game designer’s job is to make sure the game is fun and playable. This includes creating levels, designing enemies and boss fights, and balancing the gameplay mechanics.</p>
</li>
<li><p>QA Tester: Even with all the care in the world, there are bound to be some bugs in your game. Quality assurance testers play through the game repeatedly looking for bugs and potential problems.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Producer: While not technically a development skill, producers are essential for ensuring that games are completed on time and within budget. Producers keep track of schedules, handle communication between different departments, and make sure everyone is kept up to date on what’s going on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Marketing Specialist: Games don’t sell themselves – someone needs to market them properly if people are going to know about them. Marketing specialists develop marketing plans, identify target audiences, and come up with ways to reach them (such as social media campaigns, trailers, etc.).</p>
</li>
</ol>

This guide is for people who are new to modding and want to know how to get started.</p>
<p>First, you will need to install the game and the mod tools. Once you have done that, create a new folder on your computer and name it “Casino.” Now, extract the contents of the “Casino” folder in the Walking Dead Island mod tools download into your newly created Casino folder.</p>
<p>Next, open up the CasinoConfig.xml file in a text editor like Notepad and change the “BuildingType” value from “none” to “casino.” This will tell the game that you want to build a casino.</p>
<p>Now, open up the level you want to place your casino in with the Walking Dead Island level editor and place an object called “Placeable_Casino” where you want it to be. This object will act as your casino’s foundation.</p>
<p>Next, open up the CasinoLootScript.lua file in a text editor and change the “StartingGold” value from 0 to whatever amount of money you want your casino to start with.</p>
<p>Finally, save your changes and test out your new casino by launching Walking Dead Island!</p>
