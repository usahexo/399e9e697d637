#  How Much Should You Tip a Las Vegas Casino Waitress?

If you're wondering how much to tip your casino waitress in Las Vegas, we've got the answer for you.

 Tipping is always a tricky thing to figure out, but it's especially difficult when you're not familiar with the local customs. In some parts of the world, it's customary to leave a small token of appreciation for service rendered, while in others, a larger tip is expected.

In the United States, tipping is generally appreciated but not required. That said, the accepted standard for tipping casino waitresses is anywhere from $1 to $5 per drink served. If you're planning on ordering multiple drinks, it's generally best to tip at least $5.

If you're especially pleased with the service your waitress provides, you may choose to give her a larger tip - but be sure to do so in cash and not with a credit card. Tips left on credit cards are subject to a service charge by the casino.
