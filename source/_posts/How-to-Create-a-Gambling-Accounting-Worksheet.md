No matter which method you choose, there are some basic steps you'll need to follow to create your gambling accounting worksheet:

1. Create a table with two columns: "Date" and "Amount". In the Date column, list the date of each transaction. In the Amount column, list the amount of each transaction.

2. List all of your gambling transactions for the month in the table. Make sure to include the date and amount for each transaction.

3. Calculate your total income from gambling for the month. To do this, simply add up the amounts in the "Amount" column for all of the transactions in the month.

4. Calculate your total expenses from gambling for the month. To do this, add up all of the amounts in the "Amount" column for all of your losing transactions in the month. This will give you your total losses for the month. If you have any winning transactions in the month, subtract those amounts from your total losses to get your net loss for the month.

5. Record your net loss (or gain) for the month in a separate column on your worksheet. This will help you track your overall progress over time.
