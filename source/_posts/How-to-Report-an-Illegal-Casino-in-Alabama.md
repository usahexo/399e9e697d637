#  How to Find Out if a Casino is Legal in Alabama

Casinos are a big business, and like any other business, there is always the occasional legal dispute. If you're interested in opening a casino in Alabama, or if you're just curious as to whether or not a certain casino is legal in the state, you'll need to know what to look for.

The first thing to understand is that there is no single law that governs casinos in Alabama. Instead, the legality of a casino depends on a variety of factors, including the type of casino it is, who owns it, and where it's located.

With that in mind, here are some general things to look for when trying to determine if a casino is legal in Alabama:

Is the casino owned by the state? 
State-owned casinos are generally considered to be legal in Alabama. Federal law prohibits states from owning and operating gambling businesses, but there are a few exceptions for Indian tribes and charitable organizations. So long as the casino complies with tribal or charitable regulations, it should be legal in Alabama.

Is the casino located on tribal land? 
Indian casinos are generally considered to be legal in Alabama. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) allows tribes to operate gaming facilities on their lands as long as the games comply with state and federal law.

Does the casino have a license from the state lottery commission? 
Lottery commissions are responsible for regulating gambling activities in most states, including Alabama. A casino will likely need a license from the commission in order to operate legally in Alabama.

#  How to Report a Illegal Gambling Activity

Illegal gambling can take many different forms and can inflict serious financial, social and legal problems on individuals, families and communities. Reporting illegal gambling activity is the responsibility of every citizen in order to protect the public interest.

The type of information you need to report depends on the type of gambling activity. Generally, you will need to provide the name of the game or sport, the date, time and location of the game or match, the names of participants and suspects (if known) as well as any other relevant information.

If you are reporting an online gambling activity, you will need to provide the website address, name of the operator and account numbers.

It is important to keep in mind that not all gambling is illegal. Gambling activities that are legal include: playing a state-run lottery; betting on horse races conducted by a state or county racing commission; playing bingo or participating in raffles conducted by registered charities; wagering on games between friends assuming there is no profit motive involved; and enjoying games of chance in a private setting.

If you are unsure whether or not an activity constitutes illegal gambling, contact your local law enforcement agency for assistance.
