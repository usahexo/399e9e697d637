John Gambles at the Yggdrasil Casino and within minutes has lost a fortune. He had no idea that the casino was such a rip-off.

John had always enjoyed playing casino games, but he had never gambled any real money before. He had seen some adverts for the Yggdrasil Casino and decided to give it a go. He deposited Â£100 and started playing.

The first few games went well and he managed to make a small profit. However, as soon as he started playing the more high stakes games, he began to lose money rapidly. Within minutes he had lost all of his original deposit and then some.

He tried to withdraw his remaining money but was told that he needed to play through it a certain number of times before he could cash out. John felt like he had been scammed and asked one of the staff members what was going on. She told him that the casino was not a scam, but that the house always won in the end.

John was gutted and felt like he had wasted his money. If only he had known about the high odds against players at this particular casino, he would never have deposited any money there.
