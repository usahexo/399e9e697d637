#  Mets Win Again, Improved to 5-0 After Sports Betting

The Mets have been hot as of late, especially after starting the season off with a 5-0 record after sports betting.

Jason Vargas was dominant on the mound Wednesday night, striking out 10 in 7 innings of work, and the Mets bullpen did the rest en route to a 4-1 victory over the Marlins.

It was another great win for the Metropolitans, and it improved their record to 5-0 after sports betting this season. They are now one of just four teams in baseball who remain undefeated after making wagers on games, and they will look to continue their winning ways when they take on the Nationals this weekend.

The Nationals are one of the top teams in baseball, but the Mets have proved that they can compete with anyone so far this season. They will need to continue playing well if they want to make a deep playoff run this year, but with players like Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard leading the way, anything is possible.

#  Improved Odds at the Sportsbook Help Mets Sweep Braves

The New York Mets entered their three game series against the Atlanta Braves as heavy underdogs, but thanks to some improved odds at the sportsbook, they were able to sweep the series.

The Mets opened up as +200 underdogs for the series, but thanks to their sweep, they are now just +125 underdogs for their next series against the Washington Nationals. This is a big improvement for the Mets, who are currently in last place in the National League East.

While it is too early to say that the Mets are going to make a run at the playoffs, this series shows that they have some potential. The Nationals are one of the best teams in baseball, so if the Mets can compete with them, then they can compete with anyone in the league.

Overall, this was a good week for the Mets and their fans. They not only swept their opponent, but they also saw their odds improve significantly. If they can continue to play well and improve their odds even more, then there is a chance that they could make a run at the playoffs.

#  Mets Continue Good Play with Strong Sports Betting Performance

The New York Mets have been on a bit of a hot streak as of late, and that success has continued in the sports betting world. In their last 10 games, the Mets are 8-2 and have seen some very favorable odds.

One of the big wins during that span was an 11-2 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. Bettors got great value on the Mets in that game, as they closed as +120 underdogs at many sportsbooks. New York would go on to score six runs in the first inning alone and never looked back.

While not every game has resulted in a win for the Mets, they’ve still been able to cover the spread more often than not. That’s thanks largely to their high-powered offense, which is averaging over 5 runs per game this season.

The pitching staff has also been playing well lately, posting a 2.86 ERA over their last 10 games. If that trend continues, it will bode well for New York against some of their tougher opponents down the stretch.

Overall, things are looking good for the Mets as they make a playoff push. If you’re thinking about betting on them in the near future, it might be worth considering their current hot streak.

#  Bettors Showing Solid Support for New York Mets in Early Going

The New York Mets boast one of the most dedicated fanbases in all of baseball, and that fanbase is starting to show its support early on in the 2019 season.

According to oddsmakers, the Mets have the fifth-highest odds of winning the World Series this year at 15/1. That puts them behind teams like the Houston Astros (5/1), Los Angeles Dodgers (6/1), Boston Red Sox (8/1), and Chicago Cubs (10/1), but ahead of teams like the Washington Nationals (20/1) and Atlanta Braves (25/1).

 Bettors have taken notice of the Mets' strong start, as they've consistently been one of the most popular bets in both Las Vegas and online sportsbooks. In fact, New York has already seen more money wagered on them to win the World Series than any other team outside of the aforementioned four.

The fact that the Mets are getting this much love from bettors despite not being one of the favorites shows just how passionate their fanbase is. If they can keep up their current play, there's no doubt that they'll be one of the most talked about teams leading up to October.

#  New York Mets Soar in Sports Betting Following Series Victory

The New York Mets have been on a tear since their series against the Miami Marlins. Going into that series, the Mets were a disappointing 28-36, good for fourth place in the National League East. However, they swept the Marlins and have now gone 8-2 in their last ten games. This has vaulted them up the standings and into contention for a playoff spot.

While there is still a lot of baseball left to be played, the Mets hot streak has caught the eye of sports bettors. In fact, their odds of winning the World Series have skyrocketed from 66/1 to 25/1 at BetOnline.ag. They are also now favored to win the National League East at 11/4, ahead of both the Washington Nationals (5/2) and Philadelphia Phillies (3/1).

What has sparked this resurgence by the Mets? There are several factors that come into play. For one, they have been getting strong performances from their starting pitchers. Jacob deGrom has been especially impressive, going 4-0 with a 1.39 ERA over his last four starts. Noah Syndergaard has also been pitching well lately, posting a 2.38 ERA over his last four starts.

The Mets offense has also started to heat up recently. They scored seven runs or more in six of their last ten games and are now averaging 5.25 runs per game for the season as a whole. This is due in part to players like Yoenis Cespedes and Michael Conforto heating up at the plate. Cespedes is batting .324 with six homers and 20 RBI over his last ten games, while Conforto is batting .348 with four homers and 12 RBI over that same period.

If the Mets can keep playing this well, there is no doubt that they will make a run at the playoffs. With teams like the Atlanta Braves and Milwaukee Brewers currently leading their respective divisions, there is no telling who will ultimately win the NL East title. However, thanks to their current hot streak, the Mets are now one of the favorites to do so.
