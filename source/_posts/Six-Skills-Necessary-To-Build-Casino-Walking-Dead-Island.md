#  Six Skills Necessary To Build Casino Walking Dead Island

Nowadays, you can hardly find a project that doesn’t need at least some Unity skills. Walking Dead Island is no exception. To create a successful game, in addition to programming, you need to have the following skillsets:

1. Artist: No matter how well written your code is, it won’t look or feel good without good art. Artists make the world look beautiful (or gruesome, depending on the game), animate characters, and create textures and props.

2. Sound Designer: In many cases, audio can be more important than graphics in creating an immersive experience. Sound designers create sounds for everything from footsteps to weapon clashes to voice acting.

3. Game Designer: A game designer’s job is to make sure the game is fun and playable. This includes creating levels, designing enemies and boss fights, and balancing the gameplay mechanics.

4. QA Tester: Even with all the care in the world, there are bound to be some bugs in your game. Quality assurance testers play through the game repeatedly looking for bugs and potential problems.

5. Producer: While not technically a development skill, producers are essential for ensuring that games are completed on time and within budget. Producers keep track of schedules, handle communication between different departments, and make sure everyone is kept up to date on what’s going on.

6. Marketing Specialist: Games don’t sell themselves – someone needs to market them properly if people are going to know about them. Marketing specialists develop marketing plans, identify target audiences, and come up with ways to reach them (such as social media campaigns, trailers, etc.).
