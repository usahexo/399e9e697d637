#  Trump's Hotel and Casino in Africa to be run by His Son Barron

President Donald Trump's son Barron will oversee the operations of the new Trump Hotel and Casino in Africa, according to reports. The announcement comes as controversy swirls around the president's other business dealings in the country.

The hotel and casino will be built in the capital city of Mogadishu, Somalia. It is expected to be one of the largest and most luxurious hotels in all of Africa.

"This is a great opportunity for my son Barron," said President Trump in a statement to reporters. "He has always been interested in the hotel industry, and I know he will do a great job overseeing the operations of our new property in Somalia."

Some experts are concerned that giving such an important role to Barron could create conflicts of interest for the president. But Trump insists that there is no conflict and that his son will be well-suited to the task.

"My son is a smart, talented young man with a lot of experience in the hotel industry," said Trump. "He's going to do a fantastic job running our new property in Mogadishu."

The opening of the Trump Hotel and Casino in Somalia is scheduled for early 2019.

#  Trump to Run Hotel, Casino in Zimbabwe as President

President Donald Trump is considering opening a hotel and casino in Zimbabwe as part of his business empire, according to a report in the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2018-04-17/trump-s-zimbabwe-interests-go-beyond-just-mining">Bloomberg</a> news service.

Bloomberg quoted three sources familiar with the matter as saying that Trump has expressed interest in developing a hotel and casino resort in the southern African country.

The report said that one of Trump's business partners in the project is a politically well-connected Zimbabwean businessman named Strive Masiyiwa.

Masiyiwa is the founder and chairman of Econet Wireless, one of Africa's largest telecommunications companies. He also has extensive business interests in other parts of Africa.

Trump's possible investment in Zimbabwe comes as the country is experiencing a major political crisis. The ruling ZANU-PF party is embroiled in a bitter power struggle to succeed President Robert Mugabe, who has been in power since 1980.

Mugabe is 93 years old and reportedly frail, raising concerns about who will take over when he dies or steps down.

#  Trump Zinara Deal Could See Him in Control of Hotel, Casino

The Trump Zinara deal could see him in control of a hotel and casino, which would give him a new way to make money and further his brand. It's unclear what the specifics of the deal are, but it's thought that Trump will have a significant ownership stake in the property. The move is likely to raise concerns among those who feel that Trump has too many conflicts of interest.

The Trump Zinara deal comes as Trump faces increasing scrutiny over his business interests. While he has handed over control of his businesses to his children, many feel that this doesn't go far enough. There are concerns that Trump will be able to use his position as president to benefit his businesses.

Trump has dismissed these concerns, saying that he will put America first. However, the fact that he has refused to release his tax returns raises questions about just how committed he is to this idea. While there is no evidence that Trump has done anything wrong, the fact that he refuses to release his tax returns makes it difficult to know for sure.

If Trump does benefit from the Trump Zinara deal, it could create a major conflict of interest. He would be in control of a hotel and casino, which could provide him with a major stream of income. This could create an incentive for him to make decisions that are good for his businesses, rather than for America.

#  Donald Trump Could Soon Be Running a Casino Resort in Zimbabwe

Reports are emerging that U.S. President Donald Trump is looking to expand his business ventures into the African country of Zimbabwe, with plans to build a casino resort in the Victoria Falls area.

If the deal goes through, it would be Trump's first major project in Africa, and would come as the president faces increasing scrutiny at home over his business interests.

The proposed casino resort would be built on a 75-acre site near Victoria Falls Airport, and would include a casino, convention center, and luxury hotel. Trump is said to be partnering with an African development company called Intratrek Zimbabwe Ltd., which is headed by Tendai Biti â€“ a former finance minister in Zimbabwe's coalition government.

While there has been no official announcement from either Trump or Intratrek Zimbabwe Ltd., both parties are said to be in "advanced negotiations" regarding the project.

If it goes ahead, the resort is expected to create thousands of jobs for Zimbabweans, and could generate millions of dollars in revenue for the country each year.

Trump has faced criticism in recent months over his business interests around the world, with concerns that he may be using his position as president to enrich himself and his family. The proposed casino resort in Zimbabwe could add fuel to those concerns.

Critics say that Trump's businesses present potential conflicts of interest wherever they operate, and that he should sell off his businesses or place them in a blind trust to avoid any possible ethical issues.

#  Will Barron Trump Run the Trump Hotel and Casino in Zimbabwe?

The Trump Organization is likely to make a big move into the developing world, with a new hotel and casino project in Zimbabwe. The company has been in talks with the government of Zimbabwe to develop a $300 million resort on the shores of Lake Kariba.

The project would include a luxury hotel, casino, golf course, and spa. It would be Trump's first foray into Africa, and it's likely that he will face some competition from other developers who are also eyeing up investment opportunities in Zimbabwe.

Trump has faced criticism in the past for his business practices, but if this project goes ahead, it could be a major boost for the economy of Zimbabwe. The country is still struggling to recover from the years of economic recession and political turmoil that have beset it in recent years.

The Trump Organization has not yet confirmed whether it will go ahead with the project, but it looks likely that they will push ahead with it given the potential rewards on offer. The development could create thousands of jobs for Zimbabweans and help to revive the country's tourism industry.
