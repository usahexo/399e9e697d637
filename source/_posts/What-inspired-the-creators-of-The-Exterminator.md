# How do players win in The Exterminator?

One of the first things to understand about The Exterminator is that there are different ways to win. Players can either accumulate the most points, be the last one standing, or complete a certain task or set of tasks. With that in mind, it’s important for players to understand what they need to do in order to emerge victorious.

Points accumulation can be a little tricky because it relies on players taking risks. The game is all about trying to survive while also killing as many bugs as possible. The more bugs players kill, the more points they earn, so it’s important for them to take on as many enemies as possible. Of course, this also means that players are constantly at risk of being attacked and killed by enemies.

Survival is another key factor in The Exterminator. Players can’t win if they don’t survive, and this usually comes down to being smart about who they target and when they attack. It also helps to have some decent weapons and armor so that players can withstand enemy attacks.

Finally, some tasks in The Exterminator need to be completed in order for players to win the game. These tasks can vary from level to level, but typically involve finding certain objects or defeating a specific enemy. Completing these tasks is essential if players want to win, so they should always pay attention to what’s going on in the game world.

With all of these factors in mind, players should be able to come up with a strategy that works best for them. Working together with other players often makes things a lot easier, but it’s ultimately up to each individual player on how they want to approach the game.
