#  What is the Barbarian Gold?

The Barbarian Gold is an online game that tests your ability to think on your feet and make quick decisions. In the game, you play as a barbarian who is trying to amass as much gold as possible. The catch? You only have a limited amount of time to do it.

The game starts with a screen that displays the clock. There are 60 seconds on the clock, and it starts ticking down as soon as the game begins. Your goal is to click on different items in the environment to see if they are worth money. If they are, then you'll want to collect them!

The faster you can find money-making items, the more gold you'll be able to accumulate. However, be careful not to click on things that aren't worth anything – you'll lose points if you do!

At the end of the game, the total amount of gold that you've collected will be displayed. Can you beat your friends' high scores? Give it a try and see for yourself!
