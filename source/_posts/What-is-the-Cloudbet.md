#  Do you know anything about it?

Bitcoin is a digital asset and a payment system invented by Satoshi Nakamoto. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public dispersed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin is unique in that there are a finite number of them: 21 million.

Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. As of February 2015, over 100,000 merchants and vendors accepted bitcoin as payment.

The challenge in investing in Bitcoin is figuring out which companies will survive the regulatory hurdles and technical challenges to build long-term infrastructure around the cryptocurrency. Despite these challenges, hundreds of Bitcoin startups have raised over $1 billion in venture capital.
